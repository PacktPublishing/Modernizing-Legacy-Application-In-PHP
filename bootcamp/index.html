<p>You got excited when you heard about <a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>.  Perhaps you even bought the book. At last, here were the step-by-step instructions to help you work your way out of your horrible legacy codebase!</p>

<p>But you never actually got started on doing the work. Or if you did, you got sidelined by day-to-day details. Maybe it was <em>too hard to keep up your motivation.</em> Maybe it's just that <em>you understand better when someone can talk you through the whole process</em>, and see the steps being performed, instead of only reading about them.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be great if there was some way to <em>get together with other people who have legacy codebases</em>, and walk through the modernizing process from beginning to end together? Then you could <em>get answers about your particular problems</em>, and share your insights with others.</p>

<h2>Boot Camp!</h2>

<p>Well, now you can, with <em>an online weekend "boot camp" for MLAPHP.</em> During the camp, you will get to <em>review the entire modernization process</em> from basic prerequisities at the beginning to setting up a DI container at the end. After that end-to-end study of the steps involved, you should be able to <em>jump-start your own modernizing project</em> much more easily.</p>

<p>This 8-hour camp will combine <em>lecture and "live" coding with examples.</em> In particular, there will be plenty of opportunity for you to get answers specific to your own modernizing situation, and to chat with other attendees. Think of it as <em>a conference training experience in the comfort of your own home</em>, without the travel hassle and hotel expense.</p>

<p>The two-day camp is on <em>Sat 11 July and Sun 12 July.</em> Each day runs from <em>12 noon to 4pm (US Central Daylight)</em>, with time for breaks built in. That makes it 10am-2pm for Pacific time zone attendees, and 1-5pm for Eastern, which should be convenient for almost everyone.</p>
