          <h2>Working Late Again</h2>

          <p>There you are, working late for the second night this week.
          Everyone else in the office has gone home. Most of the lights are
          out. Yesterday you were trying to copy a feature to a different
          section of the site, because marketing wanted their new client to
          see it there. Today, you have just finished tracking down a
          <em>globals-related bug</em> in an SQL query embedded in a page
          script. It revealed itself only after yesterday's feature addition.
          You had to <em>search across dozens of files</em> to find it. You
          commit the change, push it to the common repository, and update the
          bug report so that QA can check on it.</p>

          <p>As you pack up to go home for the night, <em>you are still
          frustrated and worried</em>. Who knows what new bug this fix will
          reveal? The work should not be this hard.</p>

          <h2>Your Legacy Application</h2>

          <p>You were so excited when you got the job. The interviews went
          well. You clearly knew more than almost everyone else there. The
          other developers seemed like they really needed your help and
          expertise. The managers gave you a new laptop and a new LCD screen
          so you could be as efficient as possible. It was the perfect setup.
          You were eager to get to work showing off your skills and abilities
          to make the application sing, and get the project back on
          schedule.</p>

          <p>But then you checked out the code base. It was a mess. It had
          been architected over several years by <em>multiple different lead
          developers</em>, and it showed. There was no consistent pattern to
          any of the structure. The oldest core of the system was <em>a
          collection of include files</em> that ran several levels deep.
          Later, someone bolted on some class-oriented libraries, and third
          person decided to try a framework rewrite. All of it was done in
          different coding styles, with different naming conventions. The
          codebase is full of <em>files that contain a mixed-up aggregagation
          of PHP, HTML, SQL, JS, and CSS</em>. And the "tests," such as they
          were, consisted of the QA team running over the site once or twice a
          week and filing bug reports.</p>

          <p>Instead of that enthusiasm you had at the start, now <em>you feel
          like a brand-new beginner each day</em>. It's humiliating. Each day
          has been a new frustration, a new "WTF?" moment replayed in a dozen
          different ways. You want very much to improve the codebase, so
          that you can impose some sense and reason onto it, but it is such an
          tangled mess of spaghetti that you don't even know where to
          start.</p>

          <p>It seems hopeless. <em>Overwhelmed and drowning in bad code</em>
          that you inherited from earlier developers, you feel ready to give
          up.</p>

          <h2>Modernize Your Legacy Application</h2>

          <p>But what if I told you it didn't have to be this way? What if I
          told you there was <em>a specific series of small, incremental
          changes</em> you could apply steadily over time to make your PHP code
          better and more modern, and make your working life easier and more
          enjoyable? Wouldn't you like to have a plan like that written down
          for you, distilled into <em>an easy-to-follow list of
          instructions</em>?</p>

          <p>My name is <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com" target="_blank">Paul
          M. Jones</a> and my book, <strong>Modernizing Legacy
          Applications in PHP</strong>, does exactly that. Using my conference
          talk <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/2667"
          target="_blank">It Was Like That When I Got Here</a> as a starting
          point, I condense 15 years experience in fixing PHP codebases down
          to a series of small, specific steps toward modernizing your
          application.</p>

          <p>As you apply these incremental fixes in order, each one building
          on the last, you will steadily <em>transform your codebase from a
          spaghetti mess to an organized, modern, testable application</em>,
          free of globals and mixed concerns. And your application will
          continue to run as each step is completed.</p>
